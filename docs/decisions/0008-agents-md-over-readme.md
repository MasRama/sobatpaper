> **Current with notes (2026-09-04).** The decision stands: root `AGENTS.md` is the primary AI context. Structure details below are v2-era: v3 uses one concise root `AGENTS.md` (no nested per-directory files), one directory per skill under `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (not flat `*.md` names like `crud-pattern`), and `npm run check` (there are no `check:agents` / `lint:layers` scripts). Body preserved as history.

# ADR 0008: AGENTS.md as primary AI context

Date: 2025-06-28
Status: Accepted

## Context

AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Devin, Copilot) need project context to generate correct code. Without context, they:
- Guess conventions (often wrong)
- Suggest patterns from other frameworks (ORMs when the project uses raw SQL)
- Miss architectural constraints (layer boundaries)
- Repeat mistakes across sessions (no memory)

README.md is for humans. It explains what the project IS, not how to work IN it. AI needs different information: conventions, anti-patterns, file structure, where to put things.

## Decision

Use `AGENTS.md` as the primary AI context file, with nested AGENTS.md files per directory and skills for deep dives.

Structure:
- `AGENTS.md` (root) — orientation, conventions, anti-patterns, skill index (<200 lines)
- `app/AGENTS.md`, `routes/AGENTS.md`, etc. — directory-specific conventions
- `.agents/skills/*.md` — on-demand deep dives (crud-pattern, sqlite-usage, auth-rbac, etc.)
- YAML frontmatter with `description` and `tags` for progressive disclosure (AGENTS.md v1.1 spec)

## Consequences

Positive:
- Universal — AGENTS.md is read by Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Devin, and Copilot
- Layered — AI reads root for orientation, loads skills only when relevant (saves context window)
- Verifiable — `npm run check:agents` and convention tests keep AGENTS.md accurate, `npm run lint:layers` enforces conventions
- Self-documenting — the conventions ARE the documentation, no separate wiki needed

Negative:
- Maintenance burden — AGENTS.md must be updated when conventions change (mitigated by check:agents + convention tests)
- Not standardized — AGENTS.md format varies by project (mitigated by YAML frontmatter + authority metadata)
- Duplicates some README content — acceptable, different audiences

## Alternatives considered

- **README.md only** — written for humans, not AI. Missing conventions, anti-patterns, file-by-file guidance.
- **.cursorrules / .windsurfrules** — vendor-specific. Locks project to one AI tool.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — process-focused (how to submit PRs), not code-focused (how to write code).
- **Inline comments only** — AI reads them but they're scattered. No global view of conventions.
