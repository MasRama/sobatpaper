# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

> ADRs explain WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT the rules are.
> AGENTS.md tells you the rules; ADRs tell you the reasoning.

## What is an ADR?

A short markdown file (1-2 pages) that records a significant architectural decision:

- **Context** — what problem were we solving?
- **Decision** — what did we choose?
- **Consequences** — what trade-offs did we accept?
- **Alternatives considered** — what else was on the table?

## Why ADRs for AI-first?

AI agents that understand WHY a convention exists make better decisions:

- An agent that knows "raw SQL was chosen because ORMs add abstraction that hides intent from AI" won't suggest adding Prisma
- An agent that knows "functions over classes because classes add ceremony without value in a function-first codebase" won't refactor to OOP
- An agent that understands the v2 Inertia decision (now superseded) knows why v3 uses direct Vue + Vite + TypeScript and feature-scoped contracts.

## Format

```markdown
# ADR NNNN: Title

Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Status: Accepted | Superseded by NNNN | Deprecated

## Context
What problem are we solving?

## Decision
What did we choose?

## Consequences
Positive: ...
Negative: ...

## Alternatives considered
- Option A — why not
- Option B — why not
```

## When to add an ADR

- Adding a new dependency
- Changing a fundamental pattern (e.g. switching from SQLite to Postgres)
- Making a trade-off that future developers might question
- Deciding NOT to do something that seems obvious (e.g. "why no ORM?")
