# Archived v2 Skills

> **Superseded — historical reference only.** These files describe the Nara v2 stack (Inertia, Svelte, Bits UI, Ultimate Express, technical-layer CRUD, starter planning) and must not be used as v3 implementation instructions. Removed from `.agents/skills/` during post-v3.0.0 normalization; kept here because the v2 workflow detail is not fully captured elsewhere.

- `inertia-patterns.md` — v2 Inertia/Svelte frontend patterns (replaced by Vue 3 + Vite + `vue-router`; see `ARCHITECTURE.md`).
- `crud-pattern.md` — v2 ten-file technical-layer CRUD workflow (replaced by the feature model; see `docs/v3/feature-model.md`).
- `new-world.md` — v2 starter-project planning skill (replaced by `nara new` + `nara make feature`; see `docs/v3/cli.md`).
- `pentest-pattern.md` — v2 OWASP mapping against old paths (`app/handlers`, `routes/web.ts`, Svelte). Current security model: `SECURITY.md`.

The v2 capability inventory and porting guidance live in `docs/v3/v2-inventory.md` and `docs/v3/migration-v2-v3.md`.

## Archived v3 guidance

> **Historical reference only.** Removed from `.agents/skills/` during the
> guidance simplification that reduced the active set to six procedural
> skills (`nara-feature-development`, `nara-api-contracts`,
> `nara-auth-rbac`, `nara-database`, `nara-frontend`, `nara-testing`).
> Authority lives in `AGENTS.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.md`; these files are not
> task guidance.

- `nara-pitfalls.md` — former "common mistakes" skill; contents duplicated policy owned by `AGENTS.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- `nara-dependencies.md` — former dependency skill; the static Allowed/Banned table is intentionally not retained elsewhere (truth is source-derived from `package.json`).
