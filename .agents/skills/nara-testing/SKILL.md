# Testing Patterns

Choose the narrowest meaningful proof for the change. Test at the
boundary where the capability's claim actually exists:

```text
CLI packaging bug
→ packed artifact test

production runtime claim
→ real process/integration test

Feature contract
→ Feature/public route test

architecture rule
→ architecture fixture
```

Coverage by claim:

```text
unit / Feature behavior
→ the Feature's own functions and contracts

route behavior
→ HTTP boundary via app.request()

repository behavior
→ public repository functions against in-memory SQLite

Vue behavior
→ mounted components in jsdom, asserting visible output

CLI behavior
→ public command functions or process boundary

architecture fixture
→ real fixture directories asserting the defended boundary rule

integration/process behavior
→ real processes for startup, serving, and project-creation claims

packed-artifact behavior
→ staged package output for distribution claims
```

## Test layout

Keep tests near the subsystem they exercise:

```text
src/features/<feature>/tests/   # Feature contracts, repositories, routes, clients
src/app/*.test.ts               # app composition and error handling
src/shared/**/*.test.ts         # shared modules
official-features/<feature>/tests/
tests/v3/                         # cross-cutting frontend, CLI, config, health
```

Use one focused test file per behavior or source module. Add a test when
a changed contract or boundary would otherwise be uncovered; do not test
incidental implementation details.

## Running tests

During development, run the narrowest affected file:

```bash
npx vitest run src/features/auth/tests/routes.test.ts
npx vitest run tests/v3/frontend.test.ts
npx vitest run tests/v3/
```

Then widen only as the change demands:

```bash
npm run check
```

`npm run check` covers the server typecheck (`lint`), the Vue typecheck
(`check:frontend`), the Vitest suite, and `nara doctor`
(`architecture:doctor`). Add `npm run build` when the change affects
production serving or the build itself, and `npm run validate:release`
only when package, distribution, or release behavior is affected — an
ordinary Feature change does not need the release suite during iteration.

## Hono route tests

Exercise routes through the app's public HTTP boundary instead of calling private handlers:

```typescript
import { randomUUID } from 'node:crypto';
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import { app } from '../../../app/server';
import { csrfHeaders, issueCsrf } from '../../../shared/security/tests/helpers';

describe('auth route', () => {
  it('rejects malformed input with field diagnostics', async () => {
    const csrf = await issueCsrf(app);
    const response = await app.request('/api/auth/register', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { ...csrfHeaders(csrf), 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        name: 'A',
        email: `${randomUUID()}@example.com`,
        password: 'short',
      }),
    });

    expect(response.status).toBe(422);
    await expect(response.json()).resolves.toMatchObject({
      success: false,
      code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR',
      errors: { name: expect.any(Array), email: expect.any(Array), password: expect.any(Array) },
    });
  });
});
```

When exercising the real app boundary, unsafe `/api/*` requests must bootstrap
and echo the CSRF cookie/header just like the browser. Only omit that step when
the test intentionally constructs a smaller Feature-local Hono application
without the app security middleware.

Cover unauthenticated (`401`), unauthorized (`403`), malformed input
(`422`), not-found (`404`), conflict, success, and unexpected-error
behavior where the route supports them. Assert the public status,
response discriminant, stable code, and observable data.

## Repository tests

Repository tests may use the configured in-memory SQLite database. Assert
SQL behavior through the public repository function and reset or isolate
database state deliberately. Do not mock away the database when the
contract is SQL behavior; use a mock only when testing a caller's
boundary in isolation.

Test parameter binding, empty collections, pagination boundaries,
uniqueness constraints, foreign-key behavior, and transaction rollback
when those cases are relevant to the changed repository.

## Vue tests

Mount Vue components with `createApp` in the configured `jsdom`
environment. Reset DOM, local storage, browser API stubs, and document
classes in `beforeEach`/`afterEach`.

```typescript
import { createApp, nextTick } from 'vue';
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import App from '../../src/app/App.vue';

it('renders the shell and reacts to a user action', async () => {
  const container = document.createElement('div');
  document.body.append(container);
  const application = createApp(App);

  application.mount(container);
  await nextTick();
  expect(container.querySelector('h1')).not.toBeNull();

  application.unmount();
  container.remove();
});
```

Test user-visible output and transitions: loading/disabled state,
validation errors, theme persistence, keyboard or click behavior, and
cleanup of listeners. Do not assert private Vue internals.

## CLI and architecture tests

CLI tests invoke the command through its public function or process
boundary and assert exit status, stdout/stderr, and filesystem effects.
Architecture tests use real fixture directories and assert the boundary
rule they defend. Packed-artifact tests exercise the staged package
output; process tests boot the real server or scaffold a real project —
use each only for the claim it proves.

## Do / Don't

- **Do** test behavior through public Feature, app, or CLI boundaries.
- **Do** keep tests deterministic and isolated from production database files.
- **Do** use Vitest utilities and typed fixtures.
- **Do** assert stable API error codes and response shapes.
- **Do** clean up mounted Vue apps, DOM nodes, and browser globals.
- **Don't** call private route handlers when `app.request()` can exercise the contract.
- **Don't** use production or developer SQLite files in tests.
- **Don't** add assertions for source text or incidental defaults.
- **Don't** rely on test execution order.
