# Auth & RBAC

Procedural guidance for modifying the local/reference Auth provider,
session/RBAC behavior, or application-level Auth composition.

## Scope: provider work, not reusable-Feature coupling

A reusable Feature must NOT directly depend on Auth implementation — not on
its routes, services, repositories, tables, or session helpers. When a
reusable Feature needs identity or authorization behavior it does not own,
it declares a typed host requirement instead:

```text
Reusable Feature
→ declares typed host requirements

Application binding
→ adapts host requirements

Chosen Auth provider
→ fulfills those requirements
```

Concretely: Users never imports Auth. Users declares `UsersServerHost` /
`UsersWebHost`; `src/app/bindings/users.server.ts` and
`src/app/bindings/users.web.ts` adapt those requirements to the selected
Auth provider. Swapping the provider means writing a new binding, never
editing the Feature. There is no DI container, service locator, or provider
registry — bindings are plain TypeScript values passed to explicit factory
arguments and route props.

## Ownership

The Auth provider owns identity end to end:

```text
Auth provider
→ identity
→ credentials
→ sessions
→ roles/permissions
→ provider-level authorization APIs
```

In the reference application that is `src/features/auth/` (`contract.ts`,
`server/accounts.ts`, `server/service.ts`, `server/access.ts`,
`server/repository.ts`, plus routes). Other capabilities reach accounts
only through the provider's public boundary or through a typed host
requirement adapted in an application-owned binding — never through direct
SQL on Auth-owned tables. Full model: `../../../ARCHITECTURE.md` and
`../../../docs/v3/database-lifecycle.md`.

## Host-requirement pattern (for reusable Features)

Declare the capability the Feature needs but does not own. The real
`UsersServerHost` is the reference shape:

```typescript
import type { UsersServerHost } from '@/features/users/server/host';

export function createUserRoutes(host: UsersServerHost) {
  // Resolve the actor through the host, never through Auth imports.
  const actor = host.resolveActor(sessionToken);
  if (!actor) return unauthorized(context);
  if (!host.canManageUsers(actor.id, 'edit')) return forbidden(context);
  if (rolesChanged && !host.canAssignRoles(actor.id)) return forbidden(context);
}
```

Adapt it in the application binding, where the Auth vocabulary is
translated into the host vocabulary:

```typescript
// src/app/bindings/users.server.ts
import { getCurrentUser, hasPermission, isAdmin } from '@/features/auth';

export const usersServerHost: UsersServerHost = {
  resolveActor: (sessionToken) => {
    const user = getCurrentUser(sessionToken);
    return user ? { id: user.id, avatar: user.avatar } : undefined;
  },
  canManageUsers: (actorId, action) => isAdmin(actorId) || hasPermission(actorId, `users.${action}`),
  canAssignRoles: (actorId) => isAdmin(actorId),
  // ...account directory, roles, session cookie name
};
```

The web side mirrors this: pages receive a `UsersWebHost` (`can()`,
`isAdmin()`, `currentSessionUser()`, `listRoles()`, `changePassword()`,
CSRF) as route props from `src/app/bindings/users.web.ts`. Users web never
imports Auth web internals.

## Direct Auth APIs (provider and bindings only)

The Auth public boundary exposes provider APIs such as `getCurrentUser`,
`hasPermission`, and `isAdmin` for application-owned composition/bindings and
legitimate public consumers. Inside the Auth provider implementation itself,
import the owning relative modules directly rather than importing Auth's own
public barrel back into itself. These public Auth APIs are not the default
recipe for an arbitrary reusable Feature — that path goes through a typed host
requirement.

Route-guard shape for provider-owned routes:

```typescript
import { getCookie } from 'hono/cookie';
import type { Context } from 'hono';
import { hasPermission, isAdmin } from './access';
import { currentUser, SESSION_COOKIE_NAME } from './service';

const user = currentUser(getCookie(context, SESSION_COOKIE_NAME));
if (!user) return unauthorized(context);
if (!isAdmin(user.id) && !hasPermission(user.id, 'users.edit')) {
  return forbidden(context);
}
```

Resolve the session before reading user data. Keep route-specific response
helpers local to the Feature; never trust a client-provided role or
permission list as the security decision.

## Permission slugs and admin bypass

Permissions follow `<resource>.<action>` (`users.view`, `users.create`,
`users.edit`, `users.delete`, `roles.view`, …). A capability may define the
permission vocabulary it requires, but the selected Auth provider owns the
persisted permission rows, roles, and assignments. In the reference app that
provider-owned data is seeded under `src/features/auth/server/seeds/`; a
reusable Feature must not write the Auth-owned permission tables itself.

The server route enforces authorization in this order:

1. resolve the session user
2. allow the `admin` bypass where the route requires it
3. check the specific permission with `hasPermission(userId, '<resource>.<action>')`

Password hashing and session creation stay inside the Auth provider. Expose
only the credential/session operations a caller actually needs; the Auth
public boundary may also intentionally expose provider-owned account-directory
and role/permission APIs for application bindings.
Session cookies stay HTTP-only with the configured expiry and production
secure flags. Never return password hashes from an API.

## Browser authorization

Browser permission gating is UX only. The server remains authoritative.

Distinguish the three layers: provider-owned/server Auth checks (the real
decision, in Hono routes), reusable Feature host requirements (`can()` /
`isAdmin()` on the web host, mirroring the server), and application-owned
adaptation (the web binding implementing the host from the Auth session).
A hidden button without the matching server check is a bug, not a fix.

## Do / Don't

- **Do** modify sessions, roles, and permissions inside the Auth provider.
- **Do** give reusable Features typed host requirements plus bindings.
- **Do** enforce permissions in Hono routes, not only in Vue.
- **Do** use the `<resource>.<action>` permission convention.
- **Don't** import Auth implementation from a reusable Feature.
- **Don't** create session logic in unrelated Features.
- **Don't** trust browser-provided roles or permissions.
- **Don't** add a second auth mechanism without an explicit specification.
