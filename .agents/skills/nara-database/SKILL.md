# Database (SQLite Usage)

How to read and write SQLite the Nara way. Lifecycle authority lives in
`../../../docs/v3/database-lifecycle.md`; this file is the working procedure.

## Ownership and lifecycle terms

Four distinct things; do not conflate them:

```text
getDatabase()
→ connection/runtime access (open, configure pragmas, close)

Feature migration files (src/features/<feature>/server/migrations/*.sql)
→ schema ownership

migrator (src/shared/database/migrator.ts)
→ migration discovery, ordering, immutable history, checksums, application

database operational commands (npm run migrate / migrate:status / db:check / db:backup …)
→ maintenance/integrity/backup lifecycle
```

`getDatabase()` opens and configures the shared connection (WAL, foreign
keys, busy timeout) and `closeDatabase()` releases it. It does not create
business tables — schema comes only from Feature migration files applied
by the migrator. Applied migrations are immutable: editing or renaming one
fails checksum verification loudly, so schema changes require forward
migrations with new globally unique numeric identifiers.

Feature-owned server persistence modules own business SQL — commonly a
`repository.ts`, but a narrowly named provider module such as Auth's account
directory is also valid. Shared database lifecycle lives in
`src/shared/database/`; route modules and browser code must not access SQLite
directly.

```typescript
import { getDatabase } from '../../../shared/database';

export function findUserById(userId: string): StoredUser | undefined {
  return getDatabase()
    .prepare(
      'SELECT id, name, email, password, avatar, created_at, updated_at FROM users WHERE id = ?',
    )
    .get(userId) as StoredUser | undefined;
}
```

Use `better-sqlite3` prepared statements for values. Keep row interfaces
near the repository that reads them or export them through the Feature's
public boundary when another module needs the type.

## Parameter binding

Never interpolate user-controlled values into SQL. Bind values through
`.get()`, `.all()`, or `.run()`:

```typescript
const pattern = `%${search}%`;
const rows = getDatabase()
  .prepare(
    `SELECT id, name
     FROM products
     WHERE name LIKE ?
     ORDER BY created_at DESC
     LIMIT ? OFFSET ?`,
  )
  .all(pattern, limit, offset) as ProductRow[];
```

For dynamic `IN` clauses, generate one placeholder per validated value:

```typescript
const placeholders = roleIds.map(() => '?').join(', ');
const rows = getDatabase()
  .prepare(`SELECT * FROM roles WHERE id IN (${placeholders})`)
  .all(...roleIds) as Role[];
```

Dynamic identifiers cannot be bound. Prefer fixed SQL; if an identifier
must be dynamic, validate it against a closed allowlist before inserting
it into the statement.

## Transactions

Use a `better-sqlite3` transaction for multi-statement writes that must be
atomic:

```typescript
const database = getDatabase();
const replace = database.transaction(() => {
  database.prepare('DELETE FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = ?').run(userId);
  const statement = database.prepare(
    `INSERT INTO user_roles (id, user_id, role_id, created_at)
     VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)`,
  );
  const now = Date.now();
  for (const roleId of roleIds) {
    statement.run(randomUUID(), userId, roleId, now);
  }
});
replace();
```

A thrown error rolls the transaction back. Use transactions for
replacement operations, junction-table synchronization, and coordinated
writes across tables.

## Pagination

Parse and normalize page/limit at the request boundary (including the maximum
limit), then pass the normalized values onward and report those same normalized
values in the API response. Use a deterministic order and a bound offset:

```typescript
const offset = (page - 1) * limit;
const data = database
  .prepare(
    `SELECT * FROM products
     ORDER BY created_at DESC, id DESC
     LIMIT ? OFFSET ?`,
  )
  .all(limit, offset) as ProductRow[];
```

Return `{ data, total }` from the repository when the API contract needs
both values. Do not accept arbitrary SQL fragments as pagination or
sorting input.

## Testing database behavior

Repository tests use the configured in-memory SQLite database and assert
through the public repository function: parameter binding, empty collections,
pagination boundaries, uniqueness constraints, foreign-key behavior, and
transaction rollback. The normal Vitest setup migrates one shared `:memory:`
connection for the suite, so ordinary Feature tests must not close it in
per-test teardown. Only a lifecycle test that deliberately owns the connection
should call `closeDatabase()`, and that test must reopen/remigrate as part of
its own setup. Never use production or developer SQLite files in tests.

## Do / Don't

- **Do** keep business SQL in the owning Feature's server persistence module.
- **Do** bind every value through prepared statements.
- **Do** use `crypto.randomUUID()` for new IDs and `Date.now()` for timestamps.
- **Do** use transactions for all-or-nothing multi-row writes.
- **Do** change schema with forward migrations, never by editing applied files.
- **Don't** put SQL in Hono route composition or Vue code.
- **Don't** use an ORM, query builder, or hidden SQL wrapper.
- **Don't** interpolate request values into SQL.
- **Don't** swallow database errors; translate only known domain failures at the route boundary.
